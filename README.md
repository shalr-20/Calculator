# **Mathematical Calculator**

This is a simple mathematical calculator built using Java. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), and division(/). The calculator operates on two input numbers and provides the result of the chosen operation.

## **Features**

**Takes 2 numbers:** Users can provide two numbers to as inputs.

**Takes an operation:** Users can provide an operation as another input to perform calculation.

**Continue or exit:** Users can continue their calculations without running the program several times and can exit when completed.
